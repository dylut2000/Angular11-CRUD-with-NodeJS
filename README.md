# Angular 11 + Node-JS + MongoDB Crud app

This app will introduce all entry level interns to learn the basic concept of :

- Angular
- Node JS (express) && Mongo DB
- Docker && Docker-compose

Feel free to use this as a template to your project.

to run the project:

## option 1:

1. start your mongoDB 
2. open your server directory in a terminal
3. enter the following commands

```
npm install
npm start
```
1. open your client directory in a terminal
3. enter the following commands
```
npm install
ng serve -o
```

## option 2:
1. install docker && docker-compose in your system
2. open your project root directory then use the following command

```
docker-compose up --build
```
the process will take long in order to get the app up

3. then go to http://localhost:4200
